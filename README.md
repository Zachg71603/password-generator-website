# password-generator-website

This project is was very fun to do once I got around to it. I am doing this later than I was supposed to, so I am familiar with JavaScript at this point, but I still found it to be a good challenge. The objective is to generate a random password for the user based on if they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. At the end our password generator is supposed to take all of the users inputs and displlay their password on the text provided. The toughest part for me personally was returning the password, but for the most part I feel I did well and I hope anyone that runs into this can find it useful, educational, or as motivation to make a password generator of their own :)
